# SQL_Challenge - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

Conduct a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. 
Six csv files provided (departments, dept_emp, dept_manager, employees, salaries, titles)

## Objectives

## Data Modeling

Inspect the CSVs and sketchout and ERD of the tables. 

## Data Engineering

- Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. 
- Specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
- Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

## Data Analysis

- Once you have a complete database, the following needs to be completed:

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

2. List employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee   number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

## BONUS 

1. Import the SQL database into Pandas.

2. Create a bar chart of average salary by title.

3. You may also include a technical report in markdown format, in which you outline the data engineering steps taken in the homework assignment.

## Submission

* Create an image file of your ERD.

* Create a `.sql` file of your table schemata.

* Create a `.sql` file of your queries.

* (Optional) Create a Jupyter Notebook of the bonus analysis.

* Create and upload a repository with the above files to GitHub and post a link on BootCamp Spot.
